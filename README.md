## Assignment
We work with images all the time, but surprisingly few computer scientists know how images really work. 
Well, we are going to fix that. Weâ€™re learning how to read and manipulate images. How? By making instagram filters.

## Requirements
1. **Basic:** read and write .bmp images by overloading the >> and << operators
2. **Basic:** add the cell shaded, gray-scale, pixelate, and blur filters
3. **Advanced:** scale an image by 1/2x or 2x
4. **Advanced:** rotate an image by 90,180, or 270 degrees
5. **Advanced:** flip an image vertically, horizontally, or over the two diagonals

## Misc
There's a shell script included in the repository named `generate_images`.
You can use it as follows:

`generate_images -f path/to/file.bmp`

This will generate all of the images for the assignment and output them into a new folder with the same name as the file.
